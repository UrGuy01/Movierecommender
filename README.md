Movie Recommender System Readme

Introduction
Welcome to our Movie Recommender System! Our system employs a bag-of-words approach to recommend movies based on their textual descriptions. By analyzing the common words and themes in movie descriptions, we provide personalized recommendations tailored to your interests and preferences.

How It Works
Our movie recommender system utilizes a bag-of-words model to generate recommendations. Here's how it works:

User Input: Users input a movie name or a textual description of their preferences.

Text Processing: The system processes the input text, breaking it down into individual words and removing any irrelevant or common words (stop words).

Feature Extraction: From the processed text, the system extracts features representing the most relevant words or phrases.

Similarity Calculation: Using these features, the system calculates the similarity between the input text and the descriptions of other movies in the database.

Recommendation Generation: Based on the calculated similarities, the system generates recommendations of movies that share similar themes or characteristics with the input.
